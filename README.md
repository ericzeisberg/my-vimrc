#A VimRC From Eric Z. Eisberg

v1.0.0

This vimrc configuration is well suited for anyone doing full stack web development in either Python or Ruby/Rails. I think it's well organized, if not original or meticulously beautiful. But I'm just a guy, and my opinion shoulnd't matter.

You can use it if you want. It'll save you the very minimal pain of configuring Vundle after you clone it, and it should "just work" with that minimal step.

*I DO NOT PROMISE IT WILL WORK*

I'm also putting it here because I lost it once, and I had to set it up again from scratch. I swore I would never do that again, so I'm posting it.
